Disclaimer: This work was created using Math Works software MATLAB with an academic license from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
            This code is not marketed by me and is free to use by anyone with a valid MATLAB license.
            
To use this simulator, make sure you have MATLAB installed. The MathWorks Symbolic Package is also recommended, but not required.
You can choose to install the Symbolic Package when you first install MATLAB or obtained it at the MathWorks website later.
Note that most universities have MATLAB licenses for you to use free of charge, if you are a student or faculty.

MATLAB download:            https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html
Symbolic Toolbox download:  https://www.mathworks.com/products/symbolic.html

Next, please download this entire directory (LFS) to your computer. YOU DO NOT NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE OTHER DIRECTORY (LFS2).

Then move the ENITRE LFS directory into your MATLAB path. MATLAB should create a default path in Documents > MATLAB.
The LFS directory files must all be contained in the same directory path on your computer to work.

Even if you are unable to locate the default path, simply open the files included in the LFS directory with MATLAB, navigate to the LFS.m file, and hit "Run" (The big green play button at the top of the screen).
MATLAB may then ask you if you want to add this file to your Path. Click "yes." You may need to add the other files to your path as well.

That's it! I hope you enjoy the program and find it useful for your work. 
You are welcome to use this program or content generated by it in published work, so long as you mention that you are using the program "Loewner Flow Simulator" by Gavin Glenn in your paper's body,
