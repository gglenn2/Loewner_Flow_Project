# Loewner_Flow_Project
Contains MATLAB code for a tool designed to simulate and visualize the flow of the chordal form of the complex-valued Loewner differential equation.
The working, usable code is containted entirely in LFS/. The folder LFS2/ is included only for interest.

For a detailed write up regarding the theory, design and results of LFS; see the file Senior Thesis.pdf
