LFS2 contains an older version of LFS, based on a different simulation algorithm.
While this algorithm seemed promising, LFS was producing much more tangible results, so development on LFS2 has, for now and the near future, stopped.
Beware, THE CODE IN LFS2 IS CURRENTLY BROKEN.
It is left here only because the algorithm may be of theoretical interest.
A long term goal of this project is to tweak the old algorithm to work as well as the one in LFS, and perhaps provide the user with a choice of which to use.

But for now this code will remain unsupported.
